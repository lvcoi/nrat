# NRAT - Network Recon & Analysis Tool

## Overview
NRAT (Network Recon & Analysis Tool) is a fast and user-friendly tool designed for network reconnaissance and analysis. It aims to address the limitations of existing tools like fping, which can be slow and cumbersome for basic tasks like scanning a subnet to identify active hosts and display their IP addresses. NRAT simplifies these operations, providing a streamlined and efficient way to gather network intelligence.

## Motivation
The creation of NRAT was driven by the frustration with the slow and cumbersome nature of traditional tools used for scanning subnets and finding hosts. NRAT is designed to make network scanning tasks quick and straightforward, printing the active hosts' IPs directly to the screen.

## Development Status
NRAT is currently in development. The tool is being actively improved with a focus on maintaining its core principle of being "fast and easy" to use.

## Installation
To install NRAT, clone the repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/lvcoi/nrat.git
```

Follow the installation instructions in the repository to set up NRAT on your system.

## Usage
After installation, you can use NRAT to scan networks and analyze network traffic. Detailed usage instructions and options can be found in the tool's documentation within the repository.

## Roadmap
- Enhance extensibility and output options.
- Modify the packets sent during scanning.
- List hosts by mDNS/DNS.
- Possibly integrate a Python console environment (similar to Scapy) for interactive analysis.

The development of NRAT will always prioritize its founding principle of being a fast and easy-to-use tool for network reconnaissance and analysis.
